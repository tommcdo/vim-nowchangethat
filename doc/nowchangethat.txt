INTRODUCTION                                    *nowchangethat*

nowchangethat.vim allows you to repeat the change command but on a different
motion. After using the change command (with the |c| operator), or in fact any
other insertion command, you can change a different motion to the same text.

MAPPINGS                                        *nowchangethat-mappings*

                                                *c.*
c.{motion}              Repeat the previous change command over {motion}.
                                                *c..*
c..                     Like |c.|, but for the current line. |linewise|

EXAMPLES                                        *nowchangethat-examples*

After changing a word to "foo" using `ciw`, change the contents of a quoted
string to "foo" using `c.i"`. You won't have to type "foo" the second time,
and you will remain in |Normal-mode|.

SETTINGS                                        *nowchangethat-settings*

To change the default mappings, simply provide your own mappings to the
commands below. The default mappings are as follows:

    nmap c.  <Plug>(change-now)
    nmap c.. <Plug>(change-now-line)

For example, to change the Normal-mode mapping to `cm`, use the following:

    nmap cm <Plug>(change-now)

This will use the mapping `cm`, and the default `c.` will not be mapped.

                                                *g:nowchangethat_no_mappings*
g:nowchangethat_no_mappings ~

If this variable is defined, the default mappings will not be created.
